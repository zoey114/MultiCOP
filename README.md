# MultiCOP: An Integrative Analysis of Microbiome-Metabolome Associations

**This repository contains code for the paper "MultiCOP: An Integrative Analysis of Microbiome-Metabolome Associations"**


### Introduction

We introduce the **MultiCOP** algorithm, a method designed for the efficient integration of microbiome and metabolome data. Its primary objective is to reveal microbe-metabolite interactions and pinpoint pertinent microbes and metabolites by leveraging correlation pursuit combined with random projection. Additionally, the **MultiCOP** algorithm is versatile, and capable of investigating associations between any two high-dimensional datasets to identify relevant features. 

The Taxon Set Enrichment Analysis ([TSEA](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/5269697/mod_resource/content/2/2020-Using%20MicrobiomeAnalyst%20for%20comprehensive%20statistical,%20functional,%20and%20meta-analysis%20of%20microbiome%20data.pdf)) is then applied to directly investigate whether the selected microbes showcase enrichments within taxon sets functionally related to the microbiome-metabolite interaction.


### Tutorial

MultiCOP requires two data tables in matrix form as input, denoted as **X** and **Y**, each with dimensions of n_sample by n_feature. The instructions for implementing MultiCOP are available in [example.Rmd](https://github.com/zoey114/MultiCOP/blob/main/example/example.md). The tutorial shows how to implement the first scenario in simulation.

#### Requirement

The function is built on R version 4.1.1. The [requirement.txt](https://github.com/zoey114/MultiCOP/blob/main/requirements.txt) file lists all the packages the notebook depends on. You can use the following command to check your R version.

```
R.version
```
