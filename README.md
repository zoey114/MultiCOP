# MultiCOP - Variable selection for Multiresponse index model via correlation pursuit 

**This repository contains code for the paper "MultiCOP: An Integrative Analysis of Microbiome-Metabolome Associations"**



### Tutorial

Multicop requires two data tables in matrix form as input, denoted as X and Y, each with dimensions of n_sample by n_feature. The instructions for implementing MultiCOP are available in [code/example/example.Rmd](https://github.com/zoey114/MultiCOP/blob/main/code/example/example.Rmd). The tutorial shows how to implement the first scenario in simulation.


### Installation:
We also create an R package for easy use.  You can download the R package [here](xxxxxxxxxxx) and install the R package by:

```{r}
install.packages("MultiCOP")
```
